I am looking for someone who has access to cheap/free electricity. 
You will get: Radeon HD 5770 multi-monitor video card (worth $120) or 5870 ($240) 
I will get: Use of some of your electricity via the video card, which will help with my distributed computing project. 
I also pay monthly IN ADVANCE to use most newer video cards. I can use Radeon 6xxx cards (like the 6850, 6870, 6950, 6970, and probably the 6990 when it comes out). Most of my workers use 5xxx cards because they run my software faster and therefore pay more. Examples include the 5750, 5770, 5830, 5850, 5870, and the mighty dual-GPU 5970 for which I pay $45/month to use. I can also use 4xxx cards and NVIDIA cards, but I pay less for those because they run my software slower for some reason. 
I know it sounds strange, but it’s for real. I can prove it. Email for more info. 
it’s NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
