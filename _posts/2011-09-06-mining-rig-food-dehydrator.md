Put Bitcoin Mining Rig Heat Exhaust To Good Use
Rather than just venting away the heat, this miner has a novel use for the byproduct of Bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin rigs make “excellent food dehydrators”, reportedly.
With a typical rig putting out tens of thousands of BTUs per day, creative miners are finding complementary uses for the exhaust heat.  Most of these uses, such as this home Bitcoin powered home water heater, are hobby projects though on a larger scale there is a busienss case where performing heat recapture is justified.
