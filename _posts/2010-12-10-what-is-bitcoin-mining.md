<p>Sometimes, you wonder about the <a href="/miner-fees-added-to-bitpay-invoices/">origin of Bitcoin</a> and the way in which it goes into circulation. Well, it simply came from being “mined”. Mining bitcoins both works to release a new Bitcoin and also adds up transactions to the available block chain. The process of mining goes by solving a computationally challenging puzzle and collecting new transactions into blocks. </p>

<p>The first one who is able to solve the puzzle can put on the block chain the next block and gets the rewards. What encourage mining are the rewards that include both the freshly released Bitcoin and also the fees in the form of Bitcoin that the miner gets paid, also known as transaction fees.</p>

<h2 id="network">Network Security</h2>

<p>Bitcoin mining is considered decentralized. Any person who has internet connection and a good hardware can readily participate. Bitcoin network’s security is dependent on this decentralization due to the fact that it makes decisions according to consensus. </p>

<p>Whenever a disagreement of the block’s inclusion in a <a href="/drive-drives-bitcoin-for-quick-rebound/">block chain occurs</a>, the decision is then made simply by majority consensus if it’s more than 50% of the mining influence agrees.</p>

<p>An organization or an individual person can obtain the power to distort the block chain if it possesses 50% more of the total BTC network’s mining power.  This concept is recognized as “51% attack”. </p>

<p>The cost to carry out that attack would be dependent mainly on the amount of mining power involved in the BTC network.  Hence the BTC network security is partially dependent on the amount of mining power employed.</p>

<p>The total mining power that’s needed in the network is directly dependent on the incentives the miners have, like the transaction fees and block reward.</p>

<h2 id="reward">Block Reward</h2>

<p>Block reward is the number of <a href="/genesis-mining-review/">new bitcoin discharged</a> with every time a block is mined. It halves in every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years.  It was in 2009 when it started at 50 and in 2014 it is already 25 bitcoin. </p>

<p>The block reward’s declining mechanism will end up releasing all bitcoin that approaches twenty-one million. As what the current Bitcoin protocol said, the cap of bitcoin is 21 million and you can no longer mine anymore the moment it will reach that number.</p>

<p>Just recently, what gives a great majority of incentive for miners is the block rewards as well. As of writing, for the last 24 hours, 0.3% of the mining income is represented by transaction fees.</p>
