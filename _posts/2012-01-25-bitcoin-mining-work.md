<h2>Genjix Descibes The “Work” That Bitcoin Mining Performs</h2>

<p>A post by Amir Taaki (genjix) on Bitcoin Media (@BitcoinMedia) describes how and why bitcoin mining performs “work”.  Excerpts:<p>

<p>Another property of a good hash function is small changes in input lead to large changes in output. This makes it difficult (practically impossible) to reverse a hash function.<p>

<p>A bitcoin miner is constantly hashing a block to see if it passes the above check. If not then it slightly modifies the block and tries again. It keeps doing this until it finds a block that passes. A valid block has been found, and the miner will broadcast this block to the network.<p>

<p>A miner’s task is to make a block and keep modifying that block so that it produces a different hash, until that hash passes a [specific] test. <p>

<p>Creating a block is not easy. It takes computational processor cycles. Ergo it takes electricity. Ergo it costs money. Creating a block usually has miniscule profit or even negative expected value. As more people mine and create blocks, the network drives up the difficulty squeezing out all the profit.<p>
