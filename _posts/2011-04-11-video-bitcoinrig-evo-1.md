A BitcoinRig.
GPUs: This rig contains two AMD HD 5850s and two AMD HD 5870s.
The description from the video shows that it hashes at 1.4 GHash/s.  At the current difficulty level at the time of this post, the calculation for generating at that level shows a result of about 17.1 BTC per day.  
At a residential electrical rate of about $0.11 per kWh, the costs to run this rig for a day totals about $2.38 USD for electricity.
