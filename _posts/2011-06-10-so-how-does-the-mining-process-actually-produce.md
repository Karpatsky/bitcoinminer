title: So how does the "mining process" actually produce bitcoins that are worth anything?  Where
  does the value come from?  It seems as though "mining" is a bit of a misnomer.  In
  reality, mining extracts something that has tangible value.  Even data mining extracts
  something that is valuable to someone, namely specific data.  What exactly is being
  mined in the case of bitcoins?

Mining is what allows bitcoin to operate without a central authority.  The output of mining is a blockchain that is used to determine that coins have not already been spent.
Compensation to the miners for doing this work occurs in the form of currency issued.  Each day about 7,200 BTC is issued to miners (50 BTC per block, a block about once every 10 minutes).
