<p>China’s central bank has warned <a href="/what-is-bitcoin/">domestic bitcoin exchanges</a> they risk being closed if found violating the country’s currency regulations. The warning came as the regulator tries to curb capital outflows following fears of continued weakness in the yuan.</p>

<p>On its website, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it has told the exchanges not to take part in financial activities such as margin lending or allow money laundering.</p>

<p>If such a violation is found “the circumstance will be serious,” and an inspection team will close down the offending exchange, PBOC said.</p>

<p>“People in the industry are watching if the regulators do more,” Wen Hao, founder of Bitpie, a Beijing-based <a href="/bitcoin-miner-antminer-s9/">bitcoin-related business</a>, told the Wall Street Journal. “They’ve never said they would close a business. Based on that statement, they are getting stricter.”</p>

<p>Chinese regulators met with the country’s three largest bitcoin exchanges last month to remind them to “strictly” follow relevant regulations.</p>

<p>Demand for the virtual currency in China has been rising in recent months, fueled by yuan’s depreciation. A bitcoin was trading at about $1,065 on Thursday.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency more than doubled in value in 2016, up 126 percent on the year. The Chinese yuan, on the contrary, suffered its worst year on record, weakening 6.5 percent.</p>

<p>China accounts for about 90 percent of all <a href="/how-to-mine-bitcoins/">bitcoin trading on exchanges</a>. The country has strict capital controls, which makes it difficult for the Chinese to convert the yuan into foreign currency and limits the amount of cash investors can move abroad. </p>

<p>That pushes Chinese investors to use the digital currency as a way to circumvent capital controls and minimize risk from the falling value of the domestic currency.</p>

<p>Bitcoin's rally to become last year’s best-performing currency has caught the attention of <a href="/irb-warns-against-bitcoin-breaks-usd-1000/">Chinese regulators</a> concerned the virtual asset was contributing to capital outflow.</p>

<p>Data released by PBOC this week showed China’s FX reserves fell below $3 trillion for the first time in six years in January. They declined by $12.3 billion to $2.9 trillion.</p>

<p><a href="/bitcoin-gambling-investments-512/">Beijing has spent more</a> than a quarter of its reserves propping up the yuan over the past two years. The reserves fell by $320 billion in 2016, after a record drop of $513 billion the previous year.</p>
