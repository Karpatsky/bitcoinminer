<p>Across United States country, <a href="/what-is-bitcoin/">regulatory policies</a> were shaping practically pointing to cryptocurrencies all over. Example of this is the newly junked Bill 2100 of North Dakota House of representatives which doesn’t move forward and without quorum.</p>

<h2>The BTC Bill of North Dakota</h2>

<p>Labor Committee and Businessmen of North Dakota last year sponsored Bill 2100 to conduct investigation on virtual currency specifically Bitcoin and produces desirability and feasibility of the topic. It tackles the transmission of money, investment permissions and license on investments. </p>

<p>The overall thought they want to expose was, Bitcoin is a <a href="/bitcoin-miner-SP20-jackson/">type of currency</a> being used on market exchange that the federal government doesn’t support it.</p>

<p>Groups like <a href="/bitcoin-miner-antminer-s9/">blockchain legislative advocacy</a> and digital currency Coin Center have highly downgraded the Bill 2100 for not giving exact meaning of “control” when defining Bitcoin. The community was prompting the North Dakota to be more cautious in choosing terms to define any allegations and specifically the Bill’s text. </p>

<p>For the time being, Coin Center questions the legislative actions taken with the Bill 2100 for wrong interpretations on money control transmission. According to Peter Valkenburgh of Coin Center, it is important to define the true meaning of technical terms so as not to commit mistake specially those innovation and permission networks.</p>

<h2>Failure on Bill Voting</h2>

<p>On Junuary, the voting of the <a href="/how-to-mine-bitcoins/">Bill 2100 took place</a>. The Senate favor the Bill to be move to the House of Representatives with a winning vote of 46. Then on the 9th of February, Business and Labor Committee has referred the first reading of the Bill. It certainly fails on March 1 with 4 Yeas and astonishing 84 Nays</p>

<p>The Bill of North Dakota certainly failed like the CA bill of virtual currency but expected to be resubmitted. Officials of the Government told everyone that they will be submitting and it will go back to the Senate.</p>

<h2>How Legislation and Regulatory Affects Consumers?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin core people are now looking at the possibility of more attempts to legislate digital currency and <a href="/irb-warns-against-bitcoin-breaks-usd-1000/">with the hope not to trigger</a> downside on the innovation. These rules of government might affect the novice and consumers located on the regional part of the country.</p>

<p>One example on this is the announcement of Coinbase to halt <a href="/bitcoin-gambling-investments-512/">operation in Hawaii</a> due to some regulations being imposed. Bitfinex also will not pursue on having license to operate in Washington. Bitlicense also of new york makes businesses stay away on the swarm. BTC advocates are hoping for nicer and humanitarian approach for them. </p>
