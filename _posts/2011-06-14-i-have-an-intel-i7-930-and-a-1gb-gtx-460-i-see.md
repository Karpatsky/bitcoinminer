Your GPU is at least 10 times as powerful (as far as Bitcoin mining is concerned) as the i7.  At the same time, your NVidia GTX 460 GPU is 1/5th or less as powerful as the mid-range AMD GPUs.  That doesn’t mean it isn’t profitable to mine, just don’t be upset that it doesn’t yield the revenue you were likely hoping to earn.
All the numbers are in the Mining Hardware Comparison on the Bitcoin wiki.  Punch in the MHash/s number into the Mining Generation Calculator to see what revenue you might be able to expect.
