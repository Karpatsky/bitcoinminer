This is one of those situations where an ugly hack (photo) costing six cents allows an air-cooled mining rig to do the job about as well as a fancy and sophisticated water cooling solution (video) costing hundreds more.
The end result?  Four ATI Radeon HD 5970s in an MSI 890FXA-GD70 and no overheating (after configuring fanspeed settings properly).
