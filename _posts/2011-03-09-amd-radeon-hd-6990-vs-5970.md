AMD RADEON HD 6990 vs 5970: First Look & Comparison (Sapphire & XFX)
First look and comparison at the new Dual-GPU 4GB Monster Sapphire AMD RADEON HD 6990 Video Card and the previous Dual GPU King the XFX HD 5970 Black.
While the new card is a step up from the 5970 if you are gaming, for mining the HD 5970 is still the king of the hill.  The  ATI SDK v2.1 is the fastest version for mining on ATI Radeon HDs, but that version is not supported on the HD 6990.
DailyTech’s coverage includes over a dozen reviews of the card.  Newegg had these cards available for sale on launch day but ninety minutes after opening the doors, these now show as being out of stock.
