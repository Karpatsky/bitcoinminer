title: I am apologize if this is a repeat question, but I cannot find any answer to
  this one anywhere. I was curious I started bit mining yesterday just for something
  to do, and its going at .0079 BTC/ day. At this rate it will take roughly 130 days
  to make 1 BTC. Now with say the Asic 50 Gh/s according to the calculators I will
  earn roughly 3.2 BTC/ day. My question being if I make the investment wil I actually
  see an improvement if everyone else does the same thing? Is it relative to others
  hardware?

Good question. The difficulty will go up as more hashing power comes online so it is relative. However, I would contend that it would still mine faster than what you have at the moment given what you have stated.
Here is a really good calculator I recommend that will help predict your profitability depending on a number of factors, such as network hash rate, difficulty, your hash rate, power usage, etc.http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/Â
