<p>Bitcoins have been taking the internet by storm for the past several years now, but what exactly are bitcoins?Bitcoin is a digital currency, which is widely used across the world as a stable alternative to various forms of legal tender. One of the major benefits of a digital currency is its ability to circumvent the need for a central bank.This makes bitcoins secure and attractive as a currency since the “printing” of the new currency isn’t regulated by any outside agents. <p>

<p>Bitcoins solves the problem most digital currencies fail to solve- how to make sure that digital signatures weren’t being used multiple times.The process of bit mining is the act of gaining bitcoin currency by solving math problems or through other means. This allows the Bitcoin miner to perform two very important actions. The first is that by bit mining, you improve the transaction record of bitcoins as a form of currency.The more used a currency is, the more stable it will be. <p>

<p>Bitcoin mining also puts bitcoins in your hands, which is valuable as a means of purchase in many circles as the use of bitcoins grows. In short, bit mining is a process that is useful to you and bitcoin stability as a whole. It is this give and take duality that has made bitcoin currency so popular.So How Does it Work? In addition to allowing you to make bitcoins, bit mining also helps ensure that the bitcoin market isn’t compromised. <p>

<p>The process you go through (which we will discuss shortly) ensures that you gain bitcoins through “legal” channels and prevents abuse of the service.This is done by dedicating computers to solving problems which are then updated on the bitcoin public ledger of transactions – also known as the block chain. This proof serves as a means of allowing others to verify that transactions have taken place.The process of bit mining has been purposely made intensive on computers. <p>

<p>This built-in system requires massive work for each computer block involved to ensure that there are no abuses in the system.In addition to this, each computer devoted space or “block" must have the right credentials to be considered for approval to enter the block chain. This is done via proof of work, which is in essence proof that the problem given by the block was solved properly.<p>

<p>In a nutshell, bit mining is the act of solving problems to gain bitcoins as profit, while building the strength of the bitcoin currency. So, how does it work and how can you get started?Getting Started with Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin mining is a legal process. It is mainly accomplished by performing SHA 256 hash verifications (basically solving a problem) in order to ensure that Bitcoin transactions are valid.This ensures that the info being passed to the block chain (public ledger) is accurate. <p>

<p>The speed of bit mining is often measured in hashes per second.The bitcoin network then compensates miners for their effort by paying those who contribute based on the amount of computer power provided. This payment comes in the form of newly issued bitcoins, transaction fees, and valid transactions when mining. In essence, the more you contribute to the computing process, the larger your share of the reward is when the process is done.<p>

<p>This all sounds complicated, but in essence, the process has been greatly simplified. You can purchase the required materials to begin bit mining from many online stores. These machines simplify a process that once was very difficult and time-consuming to do. One of the simplest ways to handle bit mining is through the use of ASIC bit miners.An ASIC bitcoin miner is a USB device that when plugged into a USB port will automate the process of mining bitcoins for you. <p>

<p>ASIC software’s sole purpose is the mining of bitcoins, a job it does efficiently. It is designed to maximize hashing power x 100 while decreasing the power required to do so. In terms of all bit mining products, it is also the simplest to use.If you are new to bit mining and want to get started, I highly recommend using the ASIC bit miner units to expedite the process. <p>

<p>The world of bit mining is large and there is plenty of info and tutorials to check out on the subject.We have only scratched the surface, but if this sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend you grab ab ASIC bit miner, and try your hand at entering the ever-evolving bit mining market.
