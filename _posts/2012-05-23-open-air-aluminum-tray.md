<h2>Aluminum Open Air Bitcoin Rig Trays</h2>

<p>Bitcoin user Rich Chomiczewski builds lightweight aluminum trays for elegantly housing all the components that go into a Bitcoin mining rig.  Rich posts on the BitcoinTalk forum as Spotswood.<p>

<p>With many mining rigs sporting multiple graphics cards, PCI-E extenders, custom airflow cooling methods and more causing bizarre looking frankenminer configurations, these trays will help allow everything to be properly arranged and mounted securely.<p>

<p>While this isn’t the only commercially available open-air alternative the need to keep plenty of space between cards requires PCI-E extenders, so most mining operators build a custom  chassis or repurpose some standard shelving into a makeshift rig.  These aluminum trays then are a slick alternative.<p>

<p>Sadly, bitcoins are not accepted for payment when ordering – PayPal only (Rich, what’s the deal with that?).<p>
