<p>Over the weekend, GAW Miners launched their cloud-based mining platform Hashlet. The system, which allows users to buy, rather than lease, hashing power in a cloud-based mining operation, was expected to have a significant demand as it went live. What wasn’t expected was that demand would be so high for the service that it would temporarily crash GAW Miners’ payment service, Shopify.<p>

<p>Reports on a variety of bitcoin-focused news sites claim that the traffic was high enough to effectively create a “natural DDoS” attack on Shopify’s servers, causing the payment gateway to return errors on over 100,000 online stores. The problem was quickly resolved by Shopify’s tech staff.<p>

<p>Speaking to Cryptocoins News about the event, GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza said: “We use Shopify, the largest e-commerce system in the world. And we literally just brought it to its knees! … We knew the response was going to be big, but we didn’t know just how big it’d get.”<p>

<p>Garza added: “We’ve been politely asked to give advance warning next time.”<p>

<p>While the demand for a new product like Hashlet is understandable, from a mining perspective it’s not entirely clear if the pay-per-GH/s model GAW Miners has created is any more profitable than traditional mining systems, or offers significant advantages over lease-based mining.<p>
