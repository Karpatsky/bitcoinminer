Hello, i was wondering, is it safe to run the bitcoin software and also the
  mining software on a pc that you use for personal use as well? I have a very nice
  personal desktop that id like to try things on before I get a better rig, to test
  the viability, but im afraid of being compromised to some kinda trojan or something
  like that. Any software or miners that you know are safe for bitcoin mining on a
  windows xp machine with a nvidia GTX560 Ti 1bg video card? Btw awesome site, and
  any other advice for starting mining would be great!
  
If you are concerned, look for an open source miner then.  Python OpenCL miner (poclbm) is one such miner (executable, source).  FYI, that 560 will earn about 0.13 BTC per day at the current difficulty level.
