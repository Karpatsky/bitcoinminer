<p>Earn Second Life Lindens by Mining BitcoinsOver the past weeks, there have been mining communities forming around specific interests.<p>

<p>First it was the XKCD pool with participation by XKCD’s creator and operated by its fans.  Then there was the Reddit Bitcoin Mining Team.<p>

<p>Now, we have Mining 4 Lindens which is a miner customized such that mining proceeds earned are converted and payout is in the form of Lindens, the virtual currency for the virtual world Second Life.<p>

<p>Bitcoins already are used to purchase Lindens, and vice-versa, courtesy of the VirWoX exchange, however this miner simplifies the process for those who are less interested in mining and markets and instead just want their balance of Lindens to grow.<p>

<p>Caveat: The software is “beta”, and this blog’s editor has nether installed it nor reviewed it.<p>
