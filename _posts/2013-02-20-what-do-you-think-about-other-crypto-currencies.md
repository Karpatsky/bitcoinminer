title: What do you think about other crypto-currencies, especially Litecoin? I mean
  when ASIC´s are common what are other GPU/FPGA miner like you gonna do? Don´t you
  think they are the future then and will grow? And AFAIk is the 2nd biggest, right?
  I don´t understand much about the has-algorythm´s they use and therefore not much
  about the hardware they need. Beside that FPGA is useless for Litecoin because they
  need a lot of memory. Any opinion or advice is sincerely appreciated. Any clue?

I am on pre-order lists for ASICs so my plans are set. I will stick with BTC for the moment.
