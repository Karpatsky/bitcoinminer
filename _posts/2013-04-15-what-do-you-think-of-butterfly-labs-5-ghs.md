<p>I think the Butterfly Labs 5GH/s miners are perfect for someone on a budget as they will provide the most bang for your buck, so to speak, as compared to what you would get from putting together a mining rig with GPU cards that could become obsolete soon after they start shipping ASICâ€™s. There is nobody out there in the industry that is putting that kind of power into a mining machine for that low of an entry-level price. Just have to be patient right now.<p>
