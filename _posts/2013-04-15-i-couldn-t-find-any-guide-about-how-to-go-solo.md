title: I couldn´t find any guide about how to go solo mining. every page says that
  is possible to go solo, but only explains poolmining. the only guide about solo
  mining is too old and doesn´t work anymore. is there another way to do that or can
  u only go pool mining?

I do not recommend solo mining anymore, although it is still possible. Your best and most profitable course of action would be to join a pool at this time.
