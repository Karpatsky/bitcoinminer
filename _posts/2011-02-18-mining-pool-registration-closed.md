<p>The operator of Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM) temporarily closed the ability to register new accounts.</p>

<p>Until the “pushwork” implementation of the pool server software is available, the additional influx of connections would require the operator to add more pool servers.  Preparing and managing those additional resources would delay completion on the new system so instead registration of new accounts was halted.</p>

<p>This follows this week’s earlier announcement regarding how compensation would change to a “score-based” algorithm.</p>
