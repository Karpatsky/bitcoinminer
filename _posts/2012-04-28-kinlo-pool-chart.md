Bitcoin Block Origin Chart
Forum member kinlo shares his new site with an interactive real-time pie chart showing hashing levels for each pool.
The duration of the charted values is 2,016 blocks â€“ the same quantity as are found between each difficulty adjustment, about two weeks of calendar time more or less.
In addition to the chart, the site provides a Block list page and also a complete list of top pools, ranked by hashing strength.
In the forum post announcing the site, an appeal is made to help identify IP addresses for more of the remaining 20% of hashing that is occurring and appears on the chart as Unknown.
