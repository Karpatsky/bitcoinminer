HardOCP’s Bitcoin Mining GPU Performance Comparison
Reviewed are a variety of configurations.  The comparisons are using the default clock speeds on all video cards tested (except for one exception, the GTX 580).  Drivers used were the latest.  For NVIDIA: ForceWare 275.50 installed. For AMD Catalyst 11.6b Hotfix installed.
The review concludes:

Be warned, you need a beefy PSU, cooling setup, and knowledge that your electricity bill will increase.
