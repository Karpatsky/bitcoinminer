title: Here's something I'm not clear on; when mining, do coins amass in your wallet,
  or is it only after you hit a bloc that you get an actual payout?  From looking
  at the calculators it would appear that you can generate coins without having to
  solve an actual block.

Bitcoins are only issues when a block is solved.  Doing so earns the solver 50 BTC.  The difficulty is so high now that it takes about 14 ATI 5970s mining solo to solve just one block over the course of one week.  
That is why you want to join forces with others in a mining pool.
