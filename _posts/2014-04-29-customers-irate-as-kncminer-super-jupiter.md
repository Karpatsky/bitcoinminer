<p>Swedish mining hardware developer KnCMiner has been flooded with customer complaints over the last week as shipments of their “Super Jupiter” miners have been arriving broken and damaged. <p>

<p>Originally offered to customers who were upset with delays in the release of the soon-to-be released Neptune mining rig line, the 3 TH/s ASIC Super Jupiter was intended to be a powerful short-term solution to a rapidly rising hashrate and diving profits.<p>

<p>KnCMiner noted the problem on their website yesterday, citing improperly secured packaging as the problem.<p>

<p>So last week we really messed up. We sent out products to our customers which arrived broken, damaged and quite frankly unusable. … There is no way our customers should have to suffer because of our mistake in not properly securing the components during shipment.<p>

<p>The company said it is operating under the assumption that all shipments were damaged, and will send replacement cards to all customers.<p>

<p>The company is not requesting the return of damaged units, and will be providing video tutorials on manually replacing damaged cards.<p>
