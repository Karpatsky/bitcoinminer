I just wanted to post a couple of handy links for everyone as I get a lot of questions regarding the efficiency/profitability of mining an various hardware.This calculator will help you estimate the profitability of mining depending on a variety of factors:http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/
And this link will help you compare the specs of various mining hardware, like GPU’s, FPGA’s, and ASIC’s.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparisonHope that helps. Stay calm and mine on!
