<h2>HexFury ASIC USB Miner</h2>

<p>In recent months, USB bitcoin miners have seemed increasingly like curiosities from a more innocent age. With the massive growth in mining difficulty (10,455,720,138 at the time of writing, and rising fast), a 1 or 2 GH/s USB stick simply can’t compete with a dedicated ASIC mining rig running in the TH/s range. <p>

<p>If they’re profitable at all after the retail price and the cost of electricity, it’s usually a matter of pennies per day. While this can be a fun, low-cost way for hobbyists to play around with bitcoin mining, the era of commercially produced USB miners appears to be drawing to a close.<p>

<p>If HexFury has its way, however, low-cost USB miners might just be making a comeback. Powered by six current-generation BitFury ASIC chips, the HexFury runs at a respectable 11 GH/s. TechCrunch’s John Biggs got his hands on one, and reported that it consistently hit about 12 GH/s.<p>

<p>He also noted:<p>

<p>“It looks like an overgrown thumb drive with exposed innards, which should give owners of inquisitive cats pause.”<p>

<p>The HexFury is theoretically hashing fast enough to generate about 0.018 BTC per month at current difficulty. That’s about $10 at current prices, meaning you’d need a little over a year and a half (at stable difficulty) to break even on the $200 miner. <p>

<p>While that’s a hard sell to an experienced bitcoin miner, it might be just the thing for a hobbyist. As Biggs noted:<p>

<p>Home mining, at this point, is more about the experience of mining than any real money making. … As these things catch up with higher-powered units, it’s only a matter of time before we can all make a few BTC a month with something the size of a stick of gum.<p>
