The obsession known as Bitcoin mining takes over yet another kitchen.  This video of “the room full of mining rigs” shows a mining operation that includes four Linux rigs plus a Windows system where the Bitcoin server resides.
After attempting to overclock the rig’s graphics cards to 850 MHz, performance had increased for a moment but shortly thereafter the system froze.
The 10 minute video, best viewed in its full YouTube HD 720p glory, was created to serve as the operating instructions for those buying the SATA drives sold pre-configured for mining.
