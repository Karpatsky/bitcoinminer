<p>The obsession known as Bitcoin mining takes over yet another kitchen.  This video of “the room full of mining rigs” shows a mining operation that includes four Linux rigs plus a Windows system where the Bitcoin server resides.</p>

<p>After attempting to overclock the rig’s graphics cards to 850 MHz, performance had increased for a moment but shortly thereafter the system froze.</p>

<p>The 10 minute video, best viewed in its full YouTube HD 720p glory, was created to serve as the operating instructions for those buying the SATA drives sold pre-configured for mining.</p>
