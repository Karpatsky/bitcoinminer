<p>Astonishing 1.3-1.7TH/s hashrate specification of a Bitcoin ASIC miner called the the SP20 Jackson which made by Spondoolies-Tech.</p>

<p>The costs of the device is $110 and is <a href="/xkcd-pool">available on eBay and Amazon</a>. It also generates ~52 dB from 1 meter which is really at low speed and its nearest rival is the AntMiner S5 surpassing hashrate with a maximum of 1.7 TH/s.</p>

<p>These units are running quite hot with mostly at higher speed. The efficiency also is poor with 0.9W/GH compared to 0.25W/GH of S5's. There is a limitation in both support and availability because Spondoolies co. has stop their operation.</p>

<h2>Compare to <a href="/overlock-gpu-mining-guide">AntMiner S5</a>, the Spondoolies is way more advance in Value</h2>

<p>The shutdown of Spondoolies took place unfortunately on May 4, 2016. The release of SP20 took place in the late of 2014. There were mining chips that were crammed by Spondoolies which is a total on eight 28nm RockerBox ASIC onto 2 circuit boards inside a compact form factor.</p>

<h2>Power Supply</h2>

<p>(1200W+) of enough wattage in any ATX PSU is needed to run the SP20 without any problems. For flexibility purposes, you may also try dual lower wattage that is (750W+) PSUs to be another option for the powerful PSU.
Bitcoins Per Month (Profitability) </p>

<p>It’s highly unlikely that the SP20 will ever pay for itself, never mind make a profit unless you have free electricity. If we write the SP20’s stats and some average costs into the CoinWarz mining profitability calculator:</p>

<p>Far less than a <a href="/bitcoin-mining">single BTC</a> will be mined in a year, therefore concluding the SP20 a waste of electricity.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>From eBay , the SP20’s price is in the region of $110.</p>

<h2>Casing</h2>

<p>With its solid, rectangular metal housing, the SP20 is easy to keep or store.</p>

<h2>Noise</h2>

<p>Compared to either the SP10 or SP30 models, the SP20’s 120mm fan is quieter. The SP20 is quiet enough to run in a home, despite the fact that it gets noisier the faster and hotter it runs.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Spondoolies’ user interface provides all the <a href="/open-source-fpga-bitcoin-miner-announced">configuration settings</a> and monitoring information you’re most likely need. The SP20 is simple enough to setup. Along with other vital info, the GUI shows temperatures and hashrate for each individual chip. To discover that sweet spot between hashrate, power and heat, you can even use it to adjust voltages (within reason) on the board.</p>

<p>The SP20 connects via Ethernet only.</p>

<h2>Temperature</h2>

<p>This unit needs to be operated in environments with temperature below 35°C / 95°F. It generates a lot of heat because it has high power consumption. During high processing speeds, the heat will cause the fan to become much louder.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>The Spondoolies SP20 was considered a notable <a href="/price-over-difficulty-chart-2011-05-26">mining device</a> during its reign. With regards to economic sense, it’s no longer practical to run an SP20 given its low efficiency, with the Bitcoin network’s current Difficulty.</p>

<p>With almost the same cost, the AntMiner S5 is way more power-efficient. Even if there’s some specific hardware mod you’d like to go with the SP20, it’s still not worth the purchase except as a piece of mining souvenir.</p>
