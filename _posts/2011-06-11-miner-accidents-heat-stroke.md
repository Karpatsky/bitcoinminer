Bitcoin Mining Accidents - Miner Who Reported Brain Damage Tells AllThe unabridged full story from Bitcoin Mining Accidents, the site with the tagline “Get Rich Or Die Mining”:

My 4 mining rigs were still mining bitcoins (I left them on 24/7), generating lots of heat. It was extremely hot. I eventually woke up due to the heat, but it was already too late.
I had a terrible heat stroke, and it was quite frightening and disorienting. I not only felt physically terrible, having trouble breathing and terrible nausea.

The miner claims to be done with mining and now plans to sell the equipment.  The brain damage could be more severe than is being reported as no miner with full faculties would even consider selling his rigs outright.
[Sorry for that.  - Editor]
Hopefully this young entrepreneur continues to recover fully.
