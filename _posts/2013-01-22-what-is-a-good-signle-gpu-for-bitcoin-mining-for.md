Better to wait for delivery of ASIC miners.  Check out Butterfly Labs.  There are others (Avalon, ASICminer) but I think BFL has the best packaging and design and are better suited for the long run. They are designing 65 nm chips compared to Avalon’s 110 nm.  They  have the best bitcoin mining hardware available IMO.
