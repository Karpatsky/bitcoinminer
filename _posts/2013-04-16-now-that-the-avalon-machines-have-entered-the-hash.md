title: Now that the Avalon machines have entered the hash pool and the BFL rigs are
  soon to be released, how do you think it will effect the small miners doing this
  as a hobby or even second source of income? Is it worth entering the hash pool with
  GPU rigs?

It will be interesting to see the effects of the ASIC releases on small/hobbyist miners. I would not recommend entering the pool by buying a new GPU rig right now, but if you already have a setup that hashes well then I would still run it until it is no longer profitable. But if you are looking to invest money at this time, I would put it into an ASIC if I were you, as there will be a much better chance of recouping your investment and profiting faster. Of course, there are always other indicators that may change along the way, but that is how I see it at this moment.
