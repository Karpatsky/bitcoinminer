<p>It will be interesting to see the effects of the ASIC releases on small/hobbyist miners. I would not recommend entering the pool by buying a new GPU rig right now, but if you already have a setup that hashes well then I would still run it until it is no longer profitable. <p>

<p>But if you are looking to invest money at this time, I would put it into an ASIC if I were you, as there will be a much better chance of recouping your investment and profiting faster. Of course, there are always other indicators that may change along the way, but that is how I see it at this moment.<p>
