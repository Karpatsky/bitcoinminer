Photos: Normal PC mining rigs
Though custom cases and massive mining operations get a lot of attention, most mining is still performed by the thousands of graphics cards, one or two at a time mounted in normal, everyday PCs.
Forum member xtoro posted a show and tell thread on the BitcoinTalk forum featuring his rig holding two Radeon HD 5830s which sits in his living room next to his TV. Â He solicits photos and replies by others who have to live with rigs to learn additional techniques.
