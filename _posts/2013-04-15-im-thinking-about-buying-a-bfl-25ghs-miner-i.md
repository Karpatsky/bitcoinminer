 <p>I'm thinking about buying a BFL 25GH/s miner. I also emailed them about when
  I should anticipate the arrival of my miner, and they said it should be somewhere

<p>While I expect the difficulty to rise once BFL releases their ASICâ€™s, I definitely do not believe that the technology will be obsolete by then, especially since there are very few players in the ASIC market at this time.<p>
