<p>Difficulty: 25998, Total network hashing: 186 Ghash/sec</p>

<p>Earlier today the difficulty threshold for generating bitcoins went from 22012 to 25998.  The difficulty readjusts every 2,016 blocks and today this happened at block 106,848.

<p>This puts the hashing strength of the entire Bitcoin network at roughly 186 Ghash/second.  Higher hashing strength for the network results in a lower likelihood of a block being solved by a miner’s computing hardware.</p>

<p>It appeared that difficulty adjustments were starting to slow as the network grew, however the increase at the last difficulty adjustment was just under 20% and this increase represents another 18% increase over the level nearly 12 days prior.</p>

<p>One factor contributing to the growth is Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM) which now accounts for over 32 Ghash/s.</p>

<p>Going forward, the following developments will likely keep increases like this continuing:</p>

<p>BitcoinRigs.com prepares to sell turnkey mining rigs.  Forum post.</p>

<p>Atlas is selling Tiny Miners</p>

<p>jgarzik is preparing a new mining pool</p>
