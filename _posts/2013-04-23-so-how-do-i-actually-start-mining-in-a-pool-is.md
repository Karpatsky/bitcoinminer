title: 'So how do I actually start mining in a pool?  Is there a list of pools somewhere,
  hopefully with ranking by payout share, etc?  I have the default program installed
  and updated: Bitcoin version v0.8.1-beta, and there''s nothing about mining solo
  OR in a pool, and didn''t even have an option to create a new Wallet, which some
  other vague instructional inclined.  My system: Radeon 7950+Intel 3570K+16GB 2400MHz
  DDR3.'
