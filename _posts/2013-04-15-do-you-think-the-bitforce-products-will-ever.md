title: Do you think the Bitforce products will ever actually ship? It looks like they've
  been "two months away" for a year. If/when they do, do you think that the value
  of Bitcoins will crash when everyone is mining at 10x-100x the rate that they previously
  were?

I do believe they will ship soon. Yes, they have had some delays but as I’ve said before, this is somewhat uncharted territory for ASIC development and I expected some issues along the way. Now, this is just an educated guess, but I do believe the opposite will happen and the Bitcoin price will go up with better, faster miners out there. Of course, that could always change depending on a number of factors that don’t simply depend on the network hash rate, as Bitcoin has shown that it is still a volatile market in its relative infancy and subject to a number of factors that dictate its price.
