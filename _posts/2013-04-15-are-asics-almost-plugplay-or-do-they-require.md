title: Are ASICs almost "plug&play" or do they require some solid knowledge (code/electronics...)

They are essentially “plug and play”, as you will generally just need to attach most of them to your computer via USB, much like the FPGA miners from the previous generation. From there, you just need to make sure that the correct drivers are installed, which “should” happen automatically, and then download and use your preferred mining software, such as CGMiner or BFGMiner, although there are others out there as well. You shouldn’t have to worry too much about coding or electronics knowledge.
