Video: Bitcoin Mining Rig ExtraordinaireA video by rjk shows a Bitcoin mining rig based on the Trenton BPX6806 backplane.
It has 18 PCI express slots making this rig capable of hosting nine cards. Â The rig is populated with seven now but the intention is to fill the rig with the remaining two eventually.
You may wish to be prepared to adjust your volume for when the rig is fired up.
