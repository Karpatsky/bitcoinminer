<p>If you are solo mining, there is no bandwidth used except that used by the Bitcoin client, which is a trivial amount â€“ much less than 100 MB per day even.<p>

<p>If you are mining using a pool, there will be a relatively constant amount of activity but that too will not add up to much, perhaps 15 MB per day or less, roughly.<p>
