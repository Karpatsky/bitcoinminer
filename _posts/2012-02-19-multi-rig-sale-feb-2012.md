For Sale: 25 Rigs (3 X HD 6990 each) + 29 loose 6990s
A ready-to-run mining operation consisting of 25 rigs is being offered for sale, according to this offer listed on Ogrr.Â  The seller wishes to sell to a single buyer but will consider offers for $25K USD or more of equipment.
Alternatively, the seller is willing to consider a revenue-share partnership where a miner with cheap electricity manages the equipment in exchange for a share of the revenues.
Each of these 3 X 6990 rigs performs about 2,100 ghash/s, according to the seller.
