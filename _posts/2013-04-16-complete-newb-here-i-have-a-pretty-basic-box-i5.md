With the exception of the new ASIC’s that are coming out, mining is dependent on the GPU that you are using and nVidia GPU’s are not nearly as good at processing the complex mathematical equations that are necessary for mining as ATI Radeon cards are.I recommend Bitcoinx: http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/It is a great way to help determine your profitability considering a number of factors.
