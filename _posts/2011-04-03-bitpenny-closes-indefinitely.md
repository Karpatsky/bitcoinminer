<p>BitPenny shuts down indefinitely [Update: Relaunches][Update: BitPenny relaunched and as-of October, 2011 exists as a pool that uses a custom, open-source mining client.]</p>

<p>One month after the second round of testing began, the Bitcoin mining pool BitPenny has shut down, indefinitely.</p>

<p>BitPenny’s operator blamed “continued and unsustainable losses” as the reason for discontinuing service.  The service could appear in the future under a different model, according to the announcement that the service would be closing.</p>

<p>The service’s method for compensating miners was particularly vulnerable to an attack where a solved block is held back from being submitted and as a result the pool is harmed.</p>

<p>Withdrawals from account balances will continue to be available, and the #bitcoin-bitpenny IRC channel will remain open.</p>

<p>There are now four public mining pool operators and the total network hashing represented by the pools has been increasing steadily.</p>
