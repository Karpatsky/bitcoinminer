<p>Beamer''s Bitcoin Revenue Calculator A post in the Bitcoin forum by community member Beamer leads to the Bitcoin Detailed Calculator.<p>

<p>This mining revenue calculator takes into account future difficulty adjustments based on your estimated rate of change.<p>

<p>Using approximate values for a typical dual AMD 6990 rig of 1400 MHash/s and a difficulty increase estimate of 25% every 10 days (change of 1.25), this rig will yield about 49 BTC over the next 6 months.  If the difficulty’s rate of increase drops to only 15%, then the BTC earned is 73 BTC., and going the other direction – if the difficulty increases 35% then only 35 BTC are earned.<p>

<p>It would not seem to be a good time to either enter mining or to be adding capacity.  Though these dry spells have occurred previously and miners who have been able to hold onto their production are those most willing to risk adding even at these levels.<p>

<p>Either way, it is nice to have a tool like this that helps show the diminishing yields as the result of future difficulty adjustments.<p>
