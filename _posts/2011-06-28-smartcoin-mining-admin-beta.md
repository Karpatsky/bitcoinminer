SmartCoin miner administration system BETA releasedSmartCoin is a full load-balanced system that tracks all of the miner instances on a machine, and reports everything on one easy to view screen.
The beta version of the software, which can be used on Linux, was recently released.
The idea is to spread many miner instances across several GPUs for multiple pools (and even solo!) on one machine.
If any one of them goes down, the system re-balances its self with any remaining good pools, and the hashing power remains the same).
