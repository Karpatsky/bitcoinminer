<p>SmartCoin miner administration system BETA releasedSmartCoin is a full load-balanced system that tracks all of the miner instances on a machine, and reports everything on one easy to view screen.<p>

<p>The beta version of the software, which can be used on Linux, was recently released.<p>

<p>The idea is to spread many miner instances across several GPUs for multiple pools (and even solo!) on one machine.<p>
<p>If any one of them goes down, the system re-balances its self with any remaining good pools, and the hashing power remains the same).<p>
