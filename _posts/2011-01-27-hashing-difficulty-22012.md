Difficulty: 22012, Total network hashing: 158 Ghash/sec
Earlier today the difficulty threshold for generating bitcoins went from 18437 to 22012.  The difficulty readjusts every 2,016 blocks and today this happened today at block 104,832.
This puts the hashing strength of the entire Bitcoin network at roughly 158 Ghash/second.  Higher hashing strength for the network results in a lower likelihood of a block being solved by a miner’s computing hardware.
Additional hashing strength across the network has been coming online at a torrid pace.  There have been some recent developments indicating this will not slow:
Vladimir leases out computing time on his mining cluster
Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM) is now responsible for over 25 Ghash/s.
The Bitcoind organization is forming solely to operate mining rigs
ATI is getting closer to shipping their Radeon HD 6990 dual GPU
