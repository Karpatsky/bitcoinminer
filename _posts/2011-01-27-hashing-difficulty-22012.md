<p>Difficulty: 22012, Total network hashing: 158 Ghash/sec</p>

<p>Earlier today the difficulty threshold for generating bitcoins went from 18437 to 22012.  The difficulty readjusts every 2,016 blocks and today this happened today at block 104,832.</p>

<p>This puts the hashing strength of the entire Bitcoin network at roughly 158 Ghash/second.  Higher hashing strength for the network results in a lower likelihood of a block being solved by a miner’s computing hardware.</p>

<p>Additional hashing strength across the network has been coming online at a torrid pace.  There have been some recent developments indicating this will not slow:</p>

<p>Vladimir leases out computing time on his mining cluster</p>

<p>Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM) is now responsible for over 25 Ghash/s.</p>

<p>The Bitcoind organization is forming solely to operate mining rigs</p>

<p>ATI is getting closer to shipping their Radeon HD 6990 dual GPU</p>
