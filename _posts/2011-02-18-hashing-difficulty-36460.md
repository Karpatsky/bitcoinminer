<h2>Difficulty: 36460, Total network hashing: 261 Ghash/sec</h2>

<p>Earlier today the difficulty threshold for generating bitcoins went from 25998 to 36460.  The difficulty readjusts every 2,016 blocks and today this happened at block 108,864.</p>

<p>This puts the hashing strength of the entire Bitcoin network at roughly 261 Ghash/second.  Higher hashing strength for the network results in a lower likelihood of a block being solved by a miner’s computing hardware.</p>

<p>The difficulty adjustments had been increasing but this spike, reflecting a 40% growth in just 10 days, is astounding.
The contributing factors include:</p>

<p>Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM) now accounts for over 60 Ghash/s, about double the level at the last difficulty change.  The recent change to a “score-based” algorithm to prevent cheating should keep interest in collaborative mining thriving.</p>

<p>Online and social media attention resulting from parity with the dollar being reached..</p>

<p>The increases in difficulty have actually lagged the increases in the BTC/USD exchange rate, and as a result, mining is and continues to be more profitable than it was in recent months.</p>

<p>While these increase may be difficult to repeat regularly, this burst likely will be sustained a bit longer as many of those interested enough to purchase hardware have yet to be able to have plugged their new computing power in yet even.</p>
