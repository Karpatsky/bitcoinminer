I don’t recommend this, but I think it is a really cool concept and these people put a lot of work into making this happen. And no, don’t use your gaming systems to mine Bitcoins, that includes your XBOX 360, PS3, Atari, etc. This is just a cool concept that I thought some might enjoy.http://retrominer.com/
