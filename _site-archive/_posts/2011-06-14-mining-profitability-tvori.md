Bitcoin Mining Profitability Chart on Tvori.info
The green line in the real-time chart is the mining profitability number.
This was created by Bitcoin forum member wizzard0 who announced this site just recently.
Of course, the actual profitability for a specific miner or rig is dependent on a number of factors, such as hardware in use, performance of the miner software, reliability and luck of a pool, the cost of electricity, and the minerâ€™s skill set.
