title: Just getting started. I could spend the $ 1300 for the new chip. What is the
  difference between that chip & the lesser $$$ chip. Also, I have newer laptop. Should
  I buy a new PC with a fast processer? If so what is recommended, especially if I
  go with the new 60GH/s chip. What is average return on investment say for 6months
  of mining? Thanks!

The difference is measured in lightyears.  No comparison. FPGA development stops when ASICs hit.  You can use any old laptop. Don’t get a new one.  www.butterflylabs.com just announced mining software for Android devices also. It is difficult to calculate investment ROI.  Try this site: bitcoin profit calculator
