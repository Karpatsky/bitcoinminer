Miners: DiabloMiner.app and RPCminer.app for MacBeginner-friendly UI wrappers for the two popular miners DiabloMiner (GPU) and RPCminer (CPU) on Mac.
For Mac OS X 10.6 and higher. Â Hashing power results will vary based on model. The Bitcoin Mining Calculator shows that the 1,000 Khash/s performed from a 9400M that is used in some models of MacBook Pro will currently generate about 0.01 BTC per day (which is worth about a U.S. nickel at current rates).
