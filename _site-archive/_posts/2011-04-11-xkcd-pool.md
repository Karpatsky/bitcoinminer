sudo make me a bitcoin!
The XKCD mining pool is now open.  The details as far as whether or not some or all mining proceeds go to support XKCD has not yet been established.  XKCD is a popular webcomic and blog.  XKCD’s forums are popular with those in software development and other technical fields.
More information on joining the pool is available from the #xkcd-bitcoin channel on the IRC server irc.foonetic.net
Other donations to support XKCD may be sent to their address: http://xkcd.com/bitcoin
