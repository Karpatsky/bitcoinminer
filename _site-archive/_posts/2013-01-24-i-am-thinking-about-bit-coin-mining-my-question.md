title: I am thinking about bit coin mining. My question is the banking industry as
  well as the CIA are seriously looking at utilizing the program much like PGP was
  during it's inception. (I worked in banking as a tech) Do you feel knowing this
  that bit coin mining is sustainable by independents as open source environment once
  aprroved by various government sectors for use?(entirely speculative question)

Everyone has their theories but I don’t buy any of it.  The bitcoin network is transparent and it would be hard to hide involvement by government or banking.  There are some extremely smart people involved with Bitcoin.  Smarter than people in Gov or banking.
