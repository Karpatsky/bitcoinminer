Steve Gibson: These people (miners) have gone nuts!
Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson discuss the topic of Bitcoin miners getting a visit by the police and also provide commentary on Jason Calicanis’ alert regarding Bitcoin being ‘The Most Dangerous Project’.
The segment covering Bitcoin begins at about 0:33:20 into the video.
Good stuff!

Leo: “But you’re not going to use 93 kWh a day, are you?”
Steve: “Apparently, yes.  These people [miners] have gone nuts!”
Steve: “It is a robust cyber currency that as far as I can see was absolutely done right.”
