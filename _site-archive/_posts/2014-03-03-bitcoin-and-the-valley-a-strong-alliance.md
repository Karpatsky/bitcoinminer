It’s no secret for anyone that Bitcoin and The Valley are creating a strong alliance as days go by. Korbit handles Bitcoin transactions currently charging 2% commission on any KRW (South Korean Won) to BTC (Bitcoin). As of now, Korbit is only trading  in KRW and BTC but hope to add more currencies in the near future. In addition to The Valley’s interest, the Bitcoin industry has also seen support from Korea’s more traditional banking infrastructure such as the Banks Foundation for Young Entrepreneurs, a group established by the country’s most important banking alliance.
