If you look at the “All Time Chart” on the Mining Profitability site you will see that the green line (BTC mining profitability) is at about its all time low.
That doesn’t mean mining is not profitable – that depends on local variables, such as hardware used, cost of electicity, etc.
Difficulty simply lags price.  Now that profitability is reaching a level where most miners are not racing to add capacity, difficulty will not likely continue growing exponentially from here – unless the price goes up again.
