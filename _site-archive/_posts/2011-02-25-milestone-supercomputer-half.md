From Bitcoin’s latest difficulty estimate of a number higher than 50,000, the total Bitcoin network strength compares at about half of what Tianhe-1A, the fastest supercomputer offers.  
Bitcoin ranks at about a quarter as powerful as Folding@Home – the most powerful distributed computing cluster in the world.
