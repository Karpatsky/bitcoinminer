Garage Miner, 3 ghash/sec
A post on Reddit from a miner includes the photo to a rack holding five rigs and some first-hand accounts from the rig owner, Never2bFound06.
The spec for each rig include 2 X ATI Radeon HD 5850s. Â Including another rig (a personal desktop w/ a 6990) the mining operation produces about 3 ghash/s.
