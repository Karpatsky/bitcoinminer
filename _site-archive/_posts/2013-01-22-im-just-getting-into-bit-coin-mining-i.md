title: I'm just getting into bit coin mining. I pre-ordered the Butterfly labs Single
  SC 60 GH/s. I am using an old Mac Pro. I realize I may need to buy a new computer
  once my Single SC arrives. What kind of computer systems should I buy, how much
  would it cost, and where is a good place to shop for one?

With BFL you can mine with an old used laptop or even an android device.  I am running a FPGA single on a 7 year old laptop.  You can get one on craigslist for cheap.
